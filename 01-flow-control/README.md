# Chapter 01 - Flow Control

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental flow control structures in C++.  
Flow control is essential for directing the execution of a program based on conditions and repetition.

You will learn how to use conditional statements, loops, switch statements, and control flow modifiers like `break` and `continue` to create predictable and responsive programs.

## 1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow branching execution paths based on evaluated conditions.

Covered constructs:

- `if`
- `else if`
- `else`

These statements execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

---

## 2. Loop Statements

Loop statements allow a block of code to execute repeatedly while a condition remains true.

Covered constructs:

- `for`
- `while`
- `do-while`

Each loop differs in how and when its condition is evaluated.

---

## 3. Switch Statements

Switch statements allow execution of one block among many options based on the value of a variable.

Covered constructs:

- `switch`
- `case`
- `default`
- `break`

They are often clearer and more maintainable than long `if-else` chains.

---

## 4. Break and Continue Statements

These statements alter the normal execution flow of loops.

- `break` exits the loop or switch immediately
- `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one

These constructs are demonstrated within loop examples.
