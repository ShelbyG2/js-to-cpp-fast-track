# C++ Learning Repo (from JavaScript)

This repo is my first C++ learning space coming from JavaScript. I’m starting with small programs and gradually building up to modern C++ (C++17/20) and the STL.

Current code: [main.cpp](main.cpp)  
Key functions: [`sum`](main.cpp), [`main`](main.cpp)

---

## What’s in here?

- **[mai.cpp](mai.cpp)**: A simple program that reads two integers and prints their sum using [`sum`](mai.cpp).

---

## Build & Run

### Compile (recommended flags)

```sh
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O2 -o mai [mai.cpp](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
```
